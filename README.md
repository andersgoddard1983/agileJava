TESTING

Agile Java isn't just for rank beginners. It's also a good book for bringing experienced programmers new to the Java language up to speed. It won't replace a certification manual or one of those huge books of “Everything Java.” That's not its point. The point of Agile Java is to get you up to speed. Better yet, you come up to speed using TDD, which will serve you well in future learning and in your day-to-day work.

The book starts right off with object-oriented concepts and ideas. It helps if you know a bit about objects when you step in, but if you don't, hang on and you should pick up the basic ideas as you go along. Furthermore, every step of the way you'll be using the Test-Driven Development technique. If you haven't tried TDD, it may seem a bit odd at the beginning, but if you're like most of us who have given it a fair try, it will become a frequently-used tool in your kit.
